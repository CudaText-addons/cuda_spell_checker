- fix: wrong underline positions for misspelled words after Emojis
- fix: in 'lite' lexer (name ends with '^') plugin must check all the text

2025.11.21 (patches by @badrelmers)
+ add: Implemented "Persistent Smart Cache". Spell check results are now saved to disk (JSON), preserving the cache across CudaText restarts.
+ add: New option "cache_lifetime" (default 60 min). Controls how long the persistent cache lasts. Set to 0 for infinite duration.
* change: "Smart Dictionary Update": Automatically detects if the source Hunspell dictionary (.dic) has been modified (by checking file size and timestamp) and regenerates the optimized word list only when necessary.

2025.11.19 (patches by @badrelmers)
* change: Refined dictionary architecture. Replaced generic "Extended Dictionaries" with an auto-generated optimized word list from the active Hunspell dictionary (stored in OS temp). This ensures O(1) lookup speed while correctly respecting language variants.
* change: Replaced manual "use_global_cache" option with "Smart Global Cache". The cache is now always active for performance but automatically clears after 30 minutes of inactivity to save memory.
* remove: Removed "Toggle the Extended Dictionary" menu and "use_extended_dictionary" option (no longer needed).
+ add: updated English dicts to newest, from 79k-words to 350k-words.

2025.11.16 (patches by @badrelmers)
* change: Major performance refactor. High-speed checking is now done against an in-memory Extended Dictionary (ext_dict/*.txt) for O(1) lookups, reducing false positives and checking a 6MB file in ~1.5s.
+ add: New menu command "Toggle the Extended Dictionary" to switch between the generic Extended Dictionary (high-speed, many words, language-variant-generic) and the language-variant-specific Hunspell dictionary.
+ add: New option "use_extended_dictionary" (1 by default).
+ add: New option "use_global_cache" (0 by default), enabling a global cache for faster non-first runs (~1s for 6MB file).
+ add: New plugin command "Create a list with all the misspelled words", like in Notepad++.
* change: Enhanced programmer filters to skip checking words that are ALL-CAPS, camelCase/MixedCase.

2025.06.07
- fix: bug with right-click menu on empty space: 'Spelling' submenu was not updated (thanks @riven)

2023.03.30 (patches by @veksha)
+ add: dialog 'Misspelled word' now uses dlg_proc API - now dialog position is kept during the app session
- fix: if user clicks another editor during long spell-checking, checking can continue the work in another editor

2023.02.23
+ add: even with CudaText option "mouse_rt_click_moves_caret":false, plugin correctly updates context menu "Spelling" submenu on right clicks

2022.12.25
+ add: use new CudaText (1.181+) event on_click_right, so setting "handle on_click" was removed; also this fixed lags on fast clicking in CudaText

2022.12.11
- fix: when editor opens N>1 tabs from startup session, only one of them was checked by Spell Checker

2022.11.29 (patch by @dinkumoil)
* change: update Enchant to v2.2.7 in order to be able to store words in user defined dictionaries under Windows

2022.11.27
* change: instead of install.inf, write event-options (on_open/on_change_slow) to plugins.ini
* change: by default, on_click handler is off, so context menu won't be updated after click on a word; to turn the on_click on - use the "Configure events" command

2022.09.29
+ add: if selection is made, 'Check text' checks only this selection (by Alexey)
* add/change: reworked lot of code by forum member 'A:C', code should work faster with big dictionary

2022.09.01
+ add: when you right click a misspelled word your cursor is over, plugin adds "Spelling" sub-menu with suggestions to the editor context menu (feature by @DUOLabs333)

2022.02.18
+ add: skip URLs on checking
+ add: option "url_regex" (thanks @DUOLabs333)

2022.01.26
- fix: on opening files, plugin ignored the setting "file_extension_list"
* change: replaced 2 menu items to configure events - with one command "Configure events" which shows new dialog
* change: to allow checking of files without extension, list item "-" in setting "file_extension_list" 

2021.08.25
+ add: i18n (patch from Markus)

2019.10.22
+ used API of CudaText 1.89 to speedup detection of syntax comments+strings - speed is greatly increased
